"Since system administration is a difficult task, many tools have been "
"developed to make life easier for the administrator.  These tools often "
"enhance the way systems are installed, configured, and maintained.  One of "
"the tools which can be used to enhance the security of a FreeBSD system is "
"_jails_.  Jails have been available since FreeBSD 4.X and continue to be "
"enhanced in their usefulness, performance, reliability, and security."

"Jails build upon the man:chroot[2] concept, which is used to change the root "
"directory of a set of processes.  This creates a safe environment, separate "
"from the rest of the system.  Processes created in the chrooted environment "
"can not access files or resources outside of it.  For that reason, "
"compromising a service running in a chrooted environment should not allow "
"the attacker to compromise the entire system."

"However, a chroot has several limitations.  It is suited to easy tasks which "
"do not require much flexibility or complex, advanced features.  Over time, "
"many ways have been found to escape from a chrooted environment, making it a "
"less than ideal solution for securing services."

"In a traditional chroot environment, processes are only limited in the part "

"system users, running processes, and the networking subsystem are shared by "
"the chrooted processes and the processes of the host system.  Jails expand "
"this model by virtualizing access to the file system, the set of users, and "
"the networking subsystem.  More fine-grained controls are available for "
"tuning the access of a jailed environment.  Jails can be considered as a "
