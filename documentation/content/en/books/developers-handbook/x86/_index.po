"Assembly language programming under UNIX(R) is highly undocumented.  It is "
"generally assumed that no one would ever want to use it because various "
"UNIX(R) systems run on different microprocessors, so everything should be "
"written in C for portability."

"In reality, C portability is quite a myth.  Even C programs need to be "

"processor each runs on.  Typically, such a program is full of conditional "
